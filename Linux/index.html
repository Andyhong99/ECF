                Our main business can be divided into three main categories. First, Combating Desertification.The Earth is becoming more and more desertified.
                To prevent this, we're targeting 60 million trees a year. Second, agriculture.
                Agroforestry Projects aim to improve the Southeast Asia, Africa low-income farmer's planting capacity by introducing agroforestry into their farms,
                so they could address and overcome their community problems, such as extreme poverty, biodiversity crisis and climate changes that mainly comes from
                their slash&burn activities.
                Third, Environmental approprite technology. The demonstration project for drinking water provision and localization
                program by Eco Child Foundation Clean Water(ECFCW) is to relief environmental damage targeting on the Southeast Asia, Africa damaged area
                by typhoon Haiyan and near by poor area
